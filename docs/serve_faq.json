How can I?"},{"Answer":"All talks will be recorded and made publicly available afterwards, pending author permission. You do not need to register in order to view the talk recordings.

Please note that the poster sessions (and probably workshops) will not be recorded and will be in-person only.","Question":"Will it be possible to attend the conference remotely? Do I need to register in order to view the talks online?"},{"Answer":"Sponsorship information is available at our <a href=\"sponsorship.html\">sponsorship page</a>.
