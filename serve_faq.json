{"FAQ":[{"QA":[{"Answer":"Unlike RLDM, we aim to have this conference on a yearly basis and it will be an archival venue. Further, the focus will be on reinforcement learning from both the algorithms and applications side.","Question":"How is this different from RLDM?"},{"Answer":"There is a call for workshops and a call for papers. Both the workshop proposal deadline is March 8, 2024 and the paper submission deadline is March 1, 2024.","Question":"When is the deadline?"},{"Answer":"We have a <a href='https://forms.gle/jWbFPRCVHjTXsPWd6'>volunteer form</a> to indicate interest. We will reach out when we have specific roles to fill.","Question":"I want to help! How can I?"},{"Answer":"All talks will be recorded and made publicly available afterwards, pending author permission. You do not need to register in order to view the talk recordings. We have chosen not to live stream the talks, given that those who cannot attend in person will be in different time zones and can watch more conveniently on their own time. Please note that the poster sessions (and probably workshops) will not be recorded and will be in-person only.","Question":"Will it be possible to attend the conference remotely? Do I need to register in order to view the talks online?"}],"Section":"General Questions"}]}
