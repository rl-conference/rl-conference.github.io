                The second Reinforcement Learning Conference (RLC) will be held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, from August 5 to 8, 2025. RLC provides a venue where reinforcement learning researchers can interact and share their research in a more focused setting than typical large machine learning venues.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
                The Reinforcement Learning Journal (RLJ) is an annual peer-reviewed publication focusing on reinforcement learning. RLJ is complemented by RLC, an associated event where researchers can present and elaborate on their findings published in RLJ. This relationship between RLJ and RLC remains unchanged from the first RLJ/RLC. It is important to note that RLJ is an independent, peer-reviewed journal that serves as a primary source of scholarly articles. The associated meeting, RLC, enhances the reach and impact of the research published within the journal.

            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
                The RLJ/RLC peer review process prioritizes rigorous methodology over subjective perceived importance, aiming to foster scholarly discussions on both well-established and emerging topics in RL.

            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
                We invite submissions presenting new and original research of interest to the reinforcement learning community. For example, research on topics including, but not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>RL algorithms (e.g., new algorithms for existing settings and new settings)</li>
                <li>Hierarchical RL (e.g., skill discovery, hierarchical representations and abstractions)</li>
                <li>Exploration (e.g., intrinsic motivation, curiosity-driven learning, exploration-exploitation tradeoff)</li>
                <li>Theoretical RL (e.g., complexity results, convergence analysis)</li>
                <li>Social and economic aspects (e.g., safety, fairness, interpretability, privacy, trustworthiness, human-AI interaction)</li>
                <li>Bandit algorithms (e.g., theoretical contributions, practical algorithms)</li>
                <li>Planning algorithms (e.g., decision-making under uncertainty, model-based approaches)</li>
                <li>Foundations (e.g., showing relationships between methods, unifying theory, clarifying misconceptions in the literature)</li>
                <li>Evaluation (e.g., methodology, meta-studies, replicability, and validity)</li>
                <li>Benchmarks (e.g., specific RL challenges, real-world applications)</li>
                <li>Applied RL (e.g., medical, operations, traffic)</li>
                <li>Deep RL (e.g., analysis of the interplay between RL and deep learning models)</li>
                <li>Multi-agent RL (e.g., cooperative, competitive, self-play)</li>
                <li>RL from human feedback (e.g., reward learning from human data, human-in-the-loop learning)</li>
                <li>Imitation Learning (e.g., learning from demonstrations, apprenticeship learning, inverse RL)</li>
                <li>Neuroscience and cognitive science work targeting a computational RL audience</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
                We also welcome interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary research that does not neatly fit into existing categories but which has an RL audience. In case of any questions, please reach out to program-chairs@rl-conference.cc.

                New to this year, authors must also submit a one-page cover page alongside the PDF file. In addition to the title and abstract of the paper, the cover page must include a box clearly stating the paper's main contributions. The submissions will be judged mostly on the contributions claimed on their cover pages and the evidence provided to support them. Major contributions should not be claimed in the main text if they do not appear on the cover page. Overclaiming can lead to a submission being rejected, so it is important to have well-scoped contribution statements on the cover page. It is up to the area chair, senior area chair, and program committee to decide whether the contribution statements should be adjusted before acceptance. Authors might be asked to modify their statement of contributions during the reviewer discussion phase and upload the modified cover page separately. Additionally, in general, contribution statements should be contextualized, clearly (and briefly) stating the state of the field before the submission. The work discussed in the contextualization needs to be relevant to the submission. Two examples of potential cover pages of classical papers in the field are provided alongside the RLJ/RLC template and submission instructions (<a href="./submissionInstructions.html">link</a>).

            <h2 class="md:text-2xl text-xl font-bai text-center text-rldarkblue-900 mb-10 mt-10">Review Process</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
                We use OpenReview for the review process. However, reviews and rejected or withdrawn papers will not be made public.
            </p>
            <h2 class="md:text-2xl text-xl font-bai text-center text-rldarkblue-900 mb-10 mt-10">Attendance</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
                 The use of LLMs and other writing tools is allowed in the preparation of submissions. However, 1) all listed authors should correspond to humans, and 2) the authors are responsible for ensuring that the content of the paper is correct and original. The authors are responsible for ensuring that plagiarized text does not occur even if the LLM is the source of the text.
            </p>
            <h2 class="md:text-2xl text-xl font-bai text-center text-rldarkblue-900 mb-10 mt-10">Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)</h2>

                The use of LLMs and other writing tools is allowed in the preparation of submissions.

            <h2 class="md:text-2xl text-xl font-bai text-center text-rldarkblue-900 mb-10 mt-10">Double-blind reviewing</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
                The review process for RLJ/RLC is double-blind. As such, authors are responsible for ensuring that their submissions do not contain any identifying information. This applies to any materials linked from the submission, such as code. Papers violating this double-blind policy may be rejected without further review.
            </p>
            <h2 class="md:text-2xl text-xl font-bai text-center text-rldarkblue-900 mb-10 mt-10">Dual submissions</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
                Authors should not submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Any such submissions may be rejected or retracted after publication. Authors may submit substantially similar versions to workshops and may publish substantially similar versions on arXiv. Notably, dual-submission with RLDM is explicitly allowed.
            </p>
            <h2 class="md:text-2xl text-xl font-bai text-center text-rldarkblue-900 mb-10 mt-10">Author response to AC questions</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
                After initial reviews have been entered in OpenReview, authors might be asked clarifying questions raised by the ACs; if so, they will have a chance to respond to them. Please note this is not an author response to reviews. In fact, the reviews will not be released to the authors until paper decisions have been finalized.
            </p>
            <h2 class="md:text-2xl text-xl font-bai text-center text-rldarkblue-900 mb-10 mt-10">Publication of accepted submissions</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
                The accepted papers will be published in the Reinforcement Learning Journal (RLJ, <a href="https://rlj.cs.umass.edu">link</a>) under ISSN 2996-8577 (online) and ISSN 2996-8569 (print). All authors of accepted papers will be required to sign the RLJ publication agreement prior to publication. Instructions for completing and uploading this form will be provided to authors of accepted papers after acceptance notification, but the content of the form can be viewed here: <a href="https://rlj.cs.umass.edu/RLC_Publication_Agreement_Form.pdf">link</a>.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
                While authors are expected to reference and discuss relevant related work, they are not expected to reference or discuss any work published within three months of the paper submission deadline.
