        <p class="c6"><span class="c1">The second Reinforcement Learning Conference (RLC) will be held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, from August 5 to 8, 2025. RLC provides a venue where reinforcement learning researchers can interact and share their research in a more focused setting than typical large machine learning venues.</span></p><p class="c6 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">The Reinforcement Learning Journal (RLJ) is an annual peer-reviewed publication focusing on reinforcement learning. RLJ is complemented by RLC, an associated event where researchers can present and elaborate on their findings published in RLJ. This relationship between RLJ and RLC remains unchanged from the first RLJ/RLC. It is important to note that RLJ is an independent, peer-reviewed journal that serves as a primary source of scholarly articles. The associated meeting, RLC, enhances the reach and impact of the research published within the journal.</span></p><p class="c6 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">The RLJ/RLC peer review process prioritizes rigorous methodology over subjective perceived importance, aiming to foster scholarly discussions on both well-established and emerging topics in RL.</span></p><p class="c6 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">We invite submissions presenting new and original research of interest to the reinforcement learning community.

Overclaiming can lead to a submission being rejected, so it is important to have well-scoped contribution statements on the cover page. It is up to the area chair, senior area chair, and program committee to decide whether the contribution statements should be adjusted before acceptance. Authors might be asked to modify their statement of contributions during the reviewer discussion phase and upload the modified cover page separately. Additionally, in general, contribution statements should be contextualized, clearly (and briefly) stating the state of the field before the submission. The work discussed in the contextualization needs to be relevant to the submission.

All of the content before (but not including) the references is referred to as the &ldquo;main text.&rdquo; There is a recommended page limit of 8 pages and a strict page limit of 12 pages for the main text; authors should use their best judgment to edit the paper to ensure the content needed to understand the main parts of the method is included in the main text. The cover page does </span><span class="c2">not</span><span>&nbsp;count towards the 8&ndash;12 page limit. Main texts of length beyond 8 pages are reserved for papers that cannot fully communicate their core scientific contributions within 8 pages (e.g., for clear and thorough proofs or plots related to additional experimentation). Reviewers may penalize papers for unnecessary main text length above 8 pages, so authors are advised to minimize length while maintaining scientific rigor. Authors should look at previously published RLJ papers for examples of expectations on writing quality and organization. </span><span class="c2">You must use the provided style file</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.overleaf.com/read/bycjnrddrxhq%23f02c55&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1767842818546762&amp;usg=AOvVaw1C0hHjhPq2FEzQCWYi0yKe">link</a></span><span>) and follow the submission instructions (</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://rl-conference.cc/2025/submissionInstructions.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1767842818547139&amp;usg=AOvVaw14ueDYzDKqT8xMrRXZ6vXT">link</a></span><span class="c1">). Any submissions that violate the style guidelines may be rejected without further review.</span></p><p class="c6 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">You are welcome to include supplementary materials alongside your paper submission. These can include code, extra figures, and videos. It is crucial, however, that the main text stands on its own as a complete document. Please note that reviewers are not obligated to examine the supplementary materials or any text beyond the main text. Therefore, any results critical to your paper should be fully detailed within the main text itself.</span></p><p class="c6 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Note:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The main text ends when the references begin. Appendices before the references are viewed as part of the main text and are subject to the 8-12 page limit, are peer-reviewed, and can contain content central to the claims of the paper. The cover page does not count towards the page limit. The Supplementary Material that appears after the references is not part of the main text, has no page limits, is not necessarily reviewed, and should not contain any claims or material central to the paper. We recommend including all parts (main text, appendices, references, and supplementary material) in a single PDF file.</span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.howo0ofnahc8"><span class="c4">Review Criteria</span></h1><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;All submissions will be evaluated by at least two reviewers, supervised by an area chair. The reviewers will evaluate the paper based on the following:</span></p><p class="c6 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_3-0 start"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Technical correctness.</span><span>&nbsp;RLJ/RLC will hold papers to a high bar for technical correctness. Submissions will be evaluated based on their suitability for publication.</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Novelty.</span><span>&nbsp;Submissions should represent original work and offer new contributions to the field of RL. Papers must not be a mere rephrasing or duplication of the authors&#39; previous research, nor should they simply recapitulate existing knowledge without providing new insights.</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Clarity of contributions.</span><span>&nbsp;Submissions should clearly delineate their contributions to the field, with a precise articulation of its novel aspects in the provided cover page. The merit of a paper is not based on the scale of advancement it provides; instead, the emphasis is on the clear and precise enumeration of the new developments it introduces.</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Support for claimed contributions.</span><span>&nbsp;Submissions should provide solid empirical and/or theoretical backing for their stated contributions and claims.</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Clarity of presentation.</span><span>&nbsp;Submissions should be well-crafted and coherently organized, demonstrating a polished and professional standard of academic writing. Confusing text, undefined mathematical symbols, and imprecise claims are valid reasons for rejection.</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Relevance to the RL community.</span><span>&nbsp;Submissions should convey clearly the relevance of the work to the reinforcement learning community, broadly defined. </span></li></ul><h1 class="c13" id="h.qmai73rkwvuo"><span class="c4">Review Process</span></h1><p class="c6"><span class="c1">We use OpenReview for the review process. However, reviews and rejected or withdrawn papers will not be made public.</span></p><h1 class="c9" id="h.j4byxltqy7b7"><span class="c4">Attendance </span></h1><p class="c6"><span class="c1">One author of each accepted paper must register for and attend the conference to present accepted papers as either a poster or talk. Exceptions to the attendance requirement may be made in extenuating circumstances (e.g., due to visa restrictions).</span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.df4g68gn68nm"><span class="c4">Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)</span></h1><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The use of LLMs and other writing tools is allowed in the preparation of submissions. However, 1) all listed authors should correspond to humans, and 2) the authors are responsible for ensuring that the content of the paper is correct and original. The authors are responsible for ensuring that plagiarized text does not occur even if the LLM is the source of the text.</span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.6j4xrbdp6gek"><span class="c4">Double-blind reviewing</span></h1><p class="c6"><span class="c1">The review process for RLJ/RLC is double-blind. As such, authors are responsible for ensuring that their submissions do not contain any identifying information. This applies to any materials linked from the submission, such as code.
